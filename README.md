omegaUp deploy
==============

Setting up an omegaUp development environment is as easy as:

1. Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/omegaup/deploy/archive/master.zip)
   and extract it somewhere.

3. Open the directory that contains `Vagrantfile` and run `vagrant up` in the
	 commandline.

You can now access the development box through
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080) and SSH into the box using
`vagrant ssh` in the same directory you ran the previous command.
